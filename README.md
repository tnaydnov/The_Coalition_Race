# The_Coalition_Race

Program description:
In a faraway democracy, SPLand, there is a political crisis, they can't form a government in years. 
The reason is complex promises about whether to cooperate with other parties.
We need you to help the politicians find a coalition!
After 5 elections, the SPLand president decided to change the method of forming a coalition by letting multiple "agents" from different parties try their best to create a 61 coalition as fast as
possible.
This assignment's goal is to try to build a coalition with 61 mandates, or report it can't be done.
